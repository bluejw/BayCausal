# glvcausal 

glvcausal is an R package that implements a Bayesian causal
discovery algorithm, as described in the paper "xxxxxxx". Grounded in the
theoretical frameworks of noisy independent analysis and factor analysis, the
algorithm is designed to accommodate potential cycles and unobserved confounders
in the true underlying directed cyclic graph.
